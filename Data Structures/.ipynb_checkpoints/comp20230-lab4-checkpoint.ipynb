    "This lab will revise and expand on some of the object oriented programming topics introduced in our lectures on creating classes and objects in Python. Mapping a problem to a class can help identify the data structures needed to store the data described in the problem and develop a solution providing the relavent algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes, Objects, Methods and Attributes\n",
    "If you need to brush up on OOP concepts, there are many online tutorials available providing further examples on the topic and these may be useful for revision, e.g.: http://www.python-course.eu/python3\\_object\\_oriented\\_programming.php\n",

    "Today we are going to code objects for airplanes and a control tower to manage the take off sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "We need to have an airplane that is identified from other airplanes by its flight number. The airplane needs fuel to fly and can be fuelled up to capacity but needs at least 1000 litres to fly. Before flying, the pilot must request clearance from the tower. The tower will check the flight number against a list of scheduled flights before granting clearance. The tower grants clearance and the pilot then performs a preflight check. If the airplane is properly fuelled and has clearance from the tower it must then take off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: Design Tasks\n",
    "1. Read and review the problem above. \n",
    "2. Write down the classes you will need to create and the attributes and methods that the classes will need. \n",
    "3. Remember nouns, verbs, adjectives can often correspond to classes, methods, and attributes. \n",
    "4. Draw a flow chart of the takeoff procedure/process. \n",
    "5. Move onto the example below and complete the coding exercises section to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code to get started\n",
    "We will start by creating an Airplane class. The basic class code is in the `Aircraft` listing below. The Airplane is an extention of the `Aircraft` class and inherits a number of methods and attributes: "
